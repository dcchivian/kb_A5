    This is a KBase wrapper for
    <https://github.com/levinas/a5" target="_blank">A5-miseq</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    A5-miseq is an updated version of the original A5 microbial assembly pipeline.
    A5-miseq is good for high-quality microbial genome assembly and does so without
    the need for parameter tuning on the part of the user. It is an integrated meta-assembly
    pipeline consisting of the following steps and tools: (1) Read cleaning with Trimmomatic;
    (2) Error correction with SGA; (3) Contig assembly with IDBA-UD; (4) Crude scaffolding with SSPACE;
    (5) Misassembly correction based on read mapping using BWA; and (6) Final scaffolding with stringent
    parameters reparing previously broken contigs.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Known limitations:</b>  A5-miseq is known to crash on some datasets due to the vulnerability associated with
    integrating a large number of third-party tools in its workflow. Due to a compatibility issue, A5-miseq is
    known to not work on the example read library rhodo.art.q20.int.PE.reads. This is because the simulated
    read library has stretched quality scores that do not play well with the SGA component in error correction.
     Another example paired-end library rhodo.art.q10.PE.reads, however, should work in this method.</p>
